# Food Finder

Food finder is a creative passion project that is an outlet for my love of nutrition. At its root, its built for exploration. The app highlights micronutrients rather than focusing on counting calories or carbohydrates. You can directly see the micronutrients that make up your food, and Food Finder will recommend items, mostly whole foods, to fill the gaps in your daily intake. The idea emerged from my curiosity about the nutrient density of my diet, my frustration with how hard it is to really know what youâ€™re putting in your body, and a lack of other products surfacing the same data.
